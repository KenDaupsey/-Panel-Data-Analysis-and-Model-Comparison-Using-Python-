# -Panel-Data-Analysis-and-Model-Comparison-Using-Python-

This repository contains a comprehensive Python implementation of panel data analysis and model comparison using the statsmodels library. The project aims to analyze a panel dataset of wages and compare the performance of different panel data models, including pooled OLS, fixed effects, and random effects models.

## Project Overview
Panel data analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze two-dimensional panel data, which involves observations of multiple entities (individuals, firms, countries, etc.) over multiple time periods. This project demonstrates how to load and preprocess a panel dataset, estimate pooled OLS, fixed effects, and random effects models, and compare their performance using various statistical metrics.

The analysis includes the following steps:

### Data Loading and Exploration: 
The project starts by loading the panel dataset and examining its structure, columns, and summary statistics.

### Pooled OLS Model: 
A pooled OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) model is estimated, treating the panel data as a single cross-section. This model ignores the panel structure and serves as a baseline for comparison.

### Fixed Effects Model: 
A fixed effects model is estimated, which controls for time-invariant, individual-specific effects. This model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity across entities.

### Random Effects Model: 
A random effects model is estimated, which treats the individual-specific effects as random variables rather than fixed constants.

### Model Comparison: 
The project compares the performance of the three models using various statistical metrics, including the Hausman test, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

### Visualizations: 
The project includes visualizations to aid in understanding the data and model results, such as plotting the average hourly wage over time.

### Dataset
The analysis is performed on the PanelDataWages1.csv dataset, which contains information about wages, work hours, occupation, location, marital status, gender, union membership, and education level for a panel of individuals over multiple years. it is available on URL:
